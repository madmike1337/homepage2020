                In my daily work as a QA-Engineer, it is important to me that a new feature is made available 
                to customers as error-free as possible. My strengths are the E2E testing scenarios. 
            </p>
            <p class="services__single-service-text">

                I create End2End testing scenarios that are supposed to "simulate" the user's behaviour. 
                The functional tests are automated by me and simulate the interaction with the 
                web application as realistically as possible. 
                This ensures that the user can interact with the functions as well as 
                individual elements of the web application. 
            </p> 
            <p class="services__single-service-text">
                <br>
                The most important functions of the web application will be tested automatically, 
                but manual testing will always be an important part of my job as a QA-Engineer. 
                You can't automate everything, a quick look how the web application 
                looks like in the browser never hurts.

                Video games have always been my passion. Whether it is on the Atari on the Amiga or on the PC. 
                I play all kinds of video games, but I always liked the competitive games where you can compete against each other. 
            </p>

                But also playing with friends on the couch in co-op mode is just great. 
                I discovered streaming for myself 7 months ago, not to become famous or to get a partnership. I like to entertain people or help them in the game or to become better. 
                But streaming a game can also be a kind of experience report, nowadays there are hardly any demos like before, you can watch a streamer playing the game.
            </p>  
            <p class="services__single-service-text">
                <br>
                I often watch streams of games I'm interested in, but I'm still not sure if I will really like the game. 
                One gets directly a first impression and if necessary one can also write a question about the game in the chat.  
            </p>      

            <p class="services__single-service-text">
                <br>
                This can lead to the fact that you buy the game for yourself.
                And that's why I stream. I play competitive games and give tips to my viewers to get better. 
                For games that are more complex, I also like to give a tutorial or a summary, what makes the game so special.

                But I have been interested in web application development for quite some time. 
                I would like to change into the role of a frontend developer to expand my creative skills and build applications that solve problems.

                I find it quite fascinating what you can build as a developer. My goal is to become more familiar with the frontend stuff, 
                which of course includes basics from HTML, CSS & Javascript. 
                If you have never had anything to do with it before as a career changer, it literally kills you.

                I am working on a few small projects to get more familiar with the subject. You can find them below this section
